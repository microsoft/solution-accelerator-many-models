# 1 - Setup Pipeline

The setup pipeline will:

- Deploy Azure Machine Learning and the other necessary resources into the resource group you specified.
- Set up the Azure Machine Learning worskpace.
- Download as many files as you specified in the `DATASET_MAXFILES` variable in the [variable group](../#3-create-variable-group), and register them as a dataset in AML.

## Instructions

Create the pipeline as explained in [here](https://github.com/microsoft/MLOpsPython/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md#create-the-iac-pipeline), selecting branch **``v2-preview``** and setting the path to [`/mlops-pipelines/1-setup/pipeline-setup.yml`](pipeline-setup.yml).

Then, run the pipeline and wait for it to finish.

## Result

The pipeline run should look like this:
